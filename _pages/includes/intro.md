I am a year-5 PhD student from the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.bit.edu.cn/), Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT, 北京理工大学计算机学院), under the supervision of [Prof. Chi Harold Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3IgFTEkAAAAJ).  I received my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from BIT (2015-2019)

My research interest includes mobile crowdsensing and unmanned vehicles, with the consideration of 5G communication modeling and reinforcement learning techniques. I have published more than 10 papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e2c7Kt0AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FsuperboySB%2FsuperboySB.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top international conferences (e.g., KDD, ICDE, CoRL, INFOCOM) and journals (e.g., TKDE, TMC).
